nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built, it said. the report comes at a time when europe\\'s competitive position is waning. the eu\\'s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe, productivity lags behind that of the us. but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far. that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.\\n\\nas mr kok\\'s report noted: \"the ink had scarcely dried on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit.\"\\n\\nthe circumstances weren\\'t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000. neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"the [lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council, a brussels-based citizen action group. \"what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. you find trade unions fighting change. but also the employers\\' associations. \"even though they tell you they\\'re in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"\\n\\nbut part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago. targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the wim report. economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\\n\\n\"lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the kok report said. \"everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" that\\'s why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they\\'re taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"rhetoric and delivery don\\'t necessarily go hand in hand,\" mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"we don\\'t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"\\n\\non one point mr kok was very clear: the european union should not try to emulate the us economy. the european economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. in that sense, the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"it\\'s very ambitious,\" said john palmer, political director at the european policy centre, a brussels-based think-tank. \"this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. it\\'s going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn\\'t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality. for example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. but it doesn\\'t say how companies should be convinced to do this. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission, jose manuel barroso, to adopt mr kok\\'s recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr barroso has said that the eu\\'s competitiveness will be his top priority. he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe\\'s success in meeting the lisbon agenda.\\n',\n",

some of britain\\'s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. there are far more important demands on government funds.\\n\\nif they can fund football, why not fund music?\\n\\nareas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.\\n\\nthe government has enough problems funding schools and health services. if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.\\n\\nas a scot living in england, i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success, so i can see no problem with it! franz ferdinand, travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods!\\n\\ni think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn\\'t be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.\\n\\nyes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.\\n\\nthere are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the \"new deal\". getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.\\n\\nas long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.\\n\\nonly if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\\'d had a government grant to get started they\\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\\'re a musician. the government shouldn\\'t \"fund\" music - it should \"invest\" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.\\n\\ni think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however, i do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.\\n\\ni do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\\'t have to fork out a great deal.\\n\\nyeah, why not? music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities\\n\\ni agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music \"pollution\", if you like.\\n\\nthough i really like franz ferdinand, i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago, this was the case with the us nea, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like save the music in the us.\\n',\n",

it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story. \\n\\n \\n\\nthe victory for the british men\\'s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener, darren campbell, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. \\n\\n \\n\\nhicham el guerrouj\\'s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly\\'s on a global scale.\\n\\nhe was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and i had finished commentating, i jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my french and his english are not very good. \\n\\n \\n\\nwhat happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.\\n\\nthings like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn\\'t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula\\'s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. \\n\\n \\n\\npurely as a race, paula\\'s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya\\'s susan chepkemei and you don\\'t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real \"bouncebackability\". and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. \\n\\n \\n\\nkelly and the 4x100m boys\\' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we\\'re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.\\n\\nthe only individual men\\'s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? and that\\'s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don\\'t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn\\'t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond. \\n\\n \\n\\ni tell you what i really enjoyed this year, benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. \\n\\n \\n\\nto be honest, i\\'m getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.\\n\\nhaving said that, i\\'m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\\n',\n",

       " 'solutions to net security fears\\n\\nfake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts.\\n\\ntrust in online security is falling as a result. almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. the survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm rsa, which carried out the poll. an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.\\n\\n\"i don\\'t think the threat is overplayed,\" barry beal, global security manager for capgemini, told the bbc news website. he added: \"the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.\" ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. \"card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. if we do that, they will indemnify us,\" he said. many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual\\'s identity. several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.\\n\\non average, people have to remember four different passwords. some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. in a separate survey by rsa, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. for many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.\\n\\nactivcard is just one of the many companies, like rsa security, which has been trying to come up with just that. rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. activcard\\'s method is more complex. it is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with uk banks. steve ash, from activcard, told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification. the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.\\n\\n\"the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both.\" the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. it combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. \"you take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. \"if you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction.\" the clever bit happens back at the bank\\'s secure servers. the code is validated by the bank\\'s systems, matching the information they expect with the customer\\'s unique key. \"each individual gets a key which is unique to them. it is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,\" said mr ash. it means that in a typical security attack, explains mr ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. \"by the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can\\'t prove who they are,\" according to mr ash. in the next few years, mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. \"pcs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards.\" the gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (pdas) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. \"the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,\" he said.\\n',\n",

up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks.\\n\\n\"high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,\" according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers.\\n\\n\"while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,\" said dr alastair brydon, author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements. \"the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [3g],\" he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised (ev-do).\\n\\nus operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are \"expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,\" said oliver valente, sprint\\'s vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. as part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, sprint will spend around $1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies, nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2, the uk-based operator with services in the uk, ireland and germany, has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) standard. using technology from lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa, using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson.\\n\\nsiemens\\' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but christoph caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: \"by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.\" siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren\\'t, those lucrative \"power users\", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.\\n',\n",

       " 'games enter the classroom\\n\\nvideo games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.\\n\\nwith violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. \"games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving,\" said martin owen, at futurelab. mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.\\n\\nfuturelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpool-based games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market. \"learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn\\'t see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,\" said dr carl gavin, managing director of lateral visions. the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. the result is racing academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.\\n\\nit is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. \"we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational,\" said mr owen. players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks mr owen.\\n\\nthe game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive. \"pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,\" said ben williamson, a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers\\' need for learning outcomes and the children\\'s desire to rise to a challenge. \"games in the classroom need to support the teacher. it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,\" he said. professor angela macfarlane, based at bristol university, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.\\n\\nuse of games in schools has been patchy she found, with sim city proving the most popular. traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. \"it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,\" she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning. \\'lite\\' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. already there are games on the market, such as civilisation and age of empire, that have educational elements said mr owen. \"even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people,\" he said. it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.\\n',\n",

the highest level of awareness is in europe.\" a european union (eu) directive, weee (waste electronic and electrical equipment), comes into effect in august. it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006.\\n\\nbut it is not just about recycling either. the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. the biggest culprit, according to the epa, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed \"energy vampires\". they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones, pdas (personal digital assistants), digital cameras, camcorders, and digital music players.\\n\\nalthough there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. on 1 january, new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct. but at ces, the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo, meaning they are about 35% more efficient. the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers\\' adaptors are being brought on board. most are made in china. about two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the us alone. the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market. \"we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply,\" the epa\\'s andrew fanara said. initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in us homes, said the epa.\\n',\n",

       " 'china \\'to overtake us net use\\'\\n\\nthe chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years, says a report.\\n\\nchina\\'s net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country\\'s 1.3 billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008. the report says that the country\\'s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.\\n\\nalready net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations, said william makower, chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this, combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only 36% of chinese homes have telephones according to reports. \"net usage tends to happen in the evening,\" said mr makower, \"they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.\" \"its fundamentally different usage to what we have here,\" he said.\\n\\nnet use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country\\'s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends, said mr makower. many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life. for instance, said mr makower, credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. \"the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery,\" he said, \"and that\\'s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.\" the arrival of foreign banks in china, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said mr makower. but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living. \"a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar,\" he said. \"generally it\\'s more difficult for the government to be able to control it.\" \"its real value is as an open window onto what\\'s happening elsewhere in the world,\" he said. government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else. familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. \"it\\'s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it,\" said mr makower.\\n',\n",

       " 'rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\\n\\nviruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.\\n\\nthe shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.\\n\\nthe growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\\n\\n\"you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\" said pete simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. \"it\\'s about outright criminality now,\" said mr simpson, explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka, aka benny from the 29a virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least, said paul king, principal security consultant at cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. \"in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,\" he said. few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. \"if you think of criminals they do not do clever,\" said mr king, \"they just do what works.\"\\n\\nas the tactics used by malicious programs change, said mr king, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.\\n\\nmany will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. \"the main motivation now is money,\" said gary stowell, spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.\\n',\n",

       " 'the future in your pocket\\n\\nif you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.\\n\\nthe relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003, vodafone launched its consumer service in november, orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.\\n\\nalready the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. \"show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and i\\'ll write their obituary\" said niel ransom, chief technology officer at alcatel.\\n\\ninstead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk\\'s first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau, principal analyst at telecom view, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.\\n\\nmoves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.\\n\\nfor a start, bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the uk\\'s net using population, can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.\\n',\n",
       " 'what high-definition will do to dvds\\n\\nfirst it was the humble home video, then it was the dvd, and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.\\n\\nhigh-definition gives incredible, 3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so, and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds, it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean, director of business development for digital content company thx, a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy, finding nemo, the incredibles and indiana jones. \"there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds,\" he told the bbc news website.\\n\\n\"the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. \"the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,\" he says. but currently, putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. \"as much as you compress the picture data rate wise, you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master,\" he explains. \"i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting.\"\\n\\nhigh-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months\\' time. mr dean is confident though: \"i think if they see real hd [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference. \"i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.\"\\n\\nhigh-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole, producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally, it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd. \"when we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,\" says mr dean. \"our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. \"that\\'s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space, you don\\'t have to compress so hard.\" studios could fit a lot more marketing material, games, and features, onto high-capacity dvds. currently, an entire dvd project can take up to three months, says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed, this will realistically only save a day\\'s work, says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks, making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay. \"if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks, it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.\" and if studios do focus on delivering more \"added value content\", thinks mr dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price, studios will listen, thinks mr dean.\\n\\nhigh-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. \"when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i, everybody was very sun-tanned, but that was make-up. \"in the hd version of episode i, all these make-up lines showed up,\" explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.\\n\\n\"there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots, there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. \"you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn\\'t see it.\" what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas, this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films, and in what format, will widen. \"in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband], giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive,\" says mr dean. but that is some time off for most, and for now, people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.\\n',\n",
       " 'mobile games come of age\\n\\nthe bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below.\\n\\nif you think of snake when some mentions \"mobile games\" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia\\'s n-gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.\\n\\nand given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders, lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles, such as colin mcrae rally, that you typically find on pcs and consoles.\\n\\nthere are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost â£5. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3d graphics.\\n\\nthe minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a \"ghost\" or \"shadow\" to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.\\n\\n too fast too furious (digital bridges) \\n\\nas soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i\\'m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.\\n\\n fatal force (macrospace) \\n\\na futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps.\\n',\n",
       " \"california sets fines for spyware\\n\\nthe makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california.\\n\\nfrom 1 january, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. the legislation, which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year. the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. at its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.\\n\\none form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. it can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. in washington, congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but california is a step ahead. the state's consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90% of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware.\\n\",\n",

the result is a work in progress called \"ipodder\". doug kaye, a california-based podcaster, praises the former mtv vj for what he has done. \"adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp3 player,\" he explains. \"people can wake up in the morning, pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that there\\'s all this new content automatically put onto their players.\" it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia, finland, brazil, even malaysia. one couple broadcasts theirs, the dawn and drew show, from wisconsin in the us, sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. topics range from the comfort of their bed, to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.\\n\\nalready, websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.\\n\\nchris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen. \"if i were to tell my mom, or my mother-in-law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator, they would think i was speaking a foreign language,\" mr mcintyre says. along with technical challenges, there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite, albeit copyrighted, music. some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the \"anti-radio\" into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. heineken is doing its own podcast now, and so is playboy. for his part, adam curry\\'s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which, he says, \"is a badge i\\'ll wear with great honour. \"to be the johnny carson, or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful. and you know what? you don\\'t need a hell of a lot of talent. \"you just have to be nice, have your ears open, and let people shine. and that\\'s good for me.\"\\n\\nclark boyd is technology correspondent for the world, a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.\\n',\n",

       " \"the force is strong in battlefront\\n\\nthe warm reception that has greeted star wars: battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.\\n\\ngeared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies. previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise's extensive universe, and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves.\\n\\nthe sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective, and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side, depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player's personal propensity for good or evil.\\n\\nthere is ample chance to be a wookie, shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up luke skywalker. in each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. it really is no more complicated than that. locations include the frozen wastes of hoth, the ice planet from the empire strikes back, complete with massive mechanical at-ats on the march. there are also the dusty, sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis, as well as the forest moon of endor, where return of the jedi's much-maligned ewoks lived. the feel of those places is well and truly captured, with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. it is worth noting though that on the playstation 2, the game's graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version. the pivotal element behind battlefront's success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. the number of combatants, noise and abundance of laser fire see to that, and the sense of chaos really comes over.\\n\\nspeaking of noise, battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy's audio motifs.\\n\\nthe multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar, as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up. there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars, it would not stand up for long. the gameplay is reliable, bog-standard stuff, short on originality. there are also odd annoyances, like the game's insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. that said, it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike, however non user-friendly they prove. whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. the above-average ai of the enemy sees to that, although given the frenetic environments they operate in, their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. battlefront's novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast, leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game. but for a while, it is an absolute blast, and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas' stable.\\n\",\n",

       " \"gta sequel is criminally good\\n\\nthe grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years, but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition.\\n\\nthe 18 certificate gta: san andreas for the playstation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach. instead, it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the driv3r and true crime-shaped opposition. even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half-life, it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic.\\n\\nthe basic gameplay remains familiar. you control a character, on this occasion a youth named cj, who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3d environment. cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane. all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family. to make things worse, he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town, and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn. the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas, comprising three major cities: los santos, which is a thinly-disguised los angeles, san fierro, aka san francisco and las venturas, a carbon copy of las vegas. san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.\\n\\nits ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold, assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city. the streets, and vast swathes of countryside, are by turns gloriously menacing, grungy and preppy. flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail, the game's overall look, particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets, is stupendous. the outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on. cars handle more convincingly than ever, a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds, and there's more traffic to navigate than before. park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway, and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up. pedestrians are also out in force, and are a loquacious bunch. cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad. they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility, aspects that the player now has control over. clothes, tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased, and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym. he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up, but will swell up as a result of over-eating. and at last, this is a gta hero who can swim.\\n\\nat a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, san andreas' violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade. developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality, and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.\\n\\nwhen hijacking a car, for example, cj will gratuitously shove the driver's head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle. indeed, the tone is darker than the jokey vice city. the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game. this title, incidentally, is set in 1992, but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists. the wit is still present, just more restrained than in previous outings. a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options, where gta games' trademark humour is anchored. the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart. the game's rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed. it is a testament to san andreas' magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws, but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don't detract. the on-screen map, for instance, is needlessly fiddly, an unwelcome change from past editions. there is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments. and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre, setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission. but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings. san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.\\n\",\n",

       " 'when invention turns to innovation\\n\\nit is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.\\n\\nwhen history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people\\'s lives substantially. but, says nick donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm, it was not \"the thing\" itself that actually improved people\\'s lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access. \"when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century, we have to think more like this, but faster,\" mr donofrio told the bbc news website, after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture. \"the invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. \"the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did.\" these are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.\\n\\nwe are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues mr donofrio, industry week\\'s 2003 technology leader of the year. the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.\\n\\n\"in the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. \"somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren\\'t quite sure that it did anything, you weren\\'t quite sure if you needed it, you weren\\'t quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool.\" but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be \"in your face\". it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage. \"i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,\" says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air. \"people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better,\" says mr donofrio. \"trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.\" natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances.\\n\\nultimately, there will be, says mr donofrio, no value in being \"computer illiterate\". to some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and \"deep computing\", says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value, according to ibm, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates.\\n\\nbut pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.\\n\\nthis is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. \"i am confident that the set [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills,\" he says. \"if i am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. \"women tend to have those traits a lot better than men.\" eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says. in the uk, a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on set industry boards. ibm, according to mr donofrio, has 30%. \"our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career.\" the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio. \"we believe in the whole issue of global diversity,\" he says. \"our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse. they expect us to look like them. \"as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'text messages aid disaster recovery\\n\\ntext messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.\\n\\nthe messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of \"who needs what and where\". blogging friends in india took mr senanayake\\'s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.\\n\\nand that\\'s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use. \"sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,\" he says.\\n\\n\"in every rural community, there\\'s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages.\" half a world away, in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago, taran rampersad read morquendi\\'s messages. mr rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said: \"imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. \"he can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.\" he added: \"or, send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.\"\\n\\nmr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.\\n\\nin only 72 hours, he found dan lane, a text message guru living in britain. the pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. \"this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,\" says paul saffo, a director at the california-based institute for the future. \"you may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you\\'re just one click or one e-mail away,\" he said, \"that\\'s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they\\'re not right on top of the tragedy.\" it is still very early days for the project, though. in an e-mail, dan lane calls it \"an early proof of concept.\" right now, the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there\\'s still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. \"it\\'s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we\\'re trying to do and everything like that,\" says mr rampersad. \"so the big problem right now is the same problem we\\'re trying to solve - human communication.\" he is optimistic, however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto, courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating.\\n\\nclark boyd is technology correspondent for the world, a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.\\n',\n",
       " 'putting a face to \\'big brother\\'\\n\\nliterally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.\\n\\nimagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london\\'s science museum, as part of its future face exhibition.\\n\\none such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer.\\n\\nhis creator, richard bowden, lecturer at the centre for vision, speech and signal processing at the university of surrey, refers to jeremiah as \"him\", rather than it. \"jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. he is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus,\" he told the bbc news website. \"when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. if you ignore him, he gets angry. if you leave, he gets sad. and you can also even surprise him.\" jeremiah is not actually intelligent. it works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. it is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. the surrey team is already working on jeremiah\\'s next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: finn the fish. \"i am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what\\'s going on and make decisions based on that,\" explained dr bowden.\\n\\nthe research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.\\n\\nexperts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. \"if you get up at three o\\'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea,\" said dr bowden. \"now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on.\" you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future. but it might all depend on the face that is watching you. \"when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,\" said dr bowden. \"but when jeremiah\\'s camera went in, nobody minded, because although it\\'s still watching them, they could see what it was watching.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"football manager scores big time\\n\\nfor the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager (cm). indeed, it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs.\\n\\nhowever, last year was the final time that developers sports interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together. they decided to go their separate ways, and each kept a piece of the franchise. si kept the game's code and database, and eidos retained rights to the cm brand, and the look and feel of the game. so at the beginning of this year, fans faced a new situation. eidos announced the next cm game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst si developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers sega, under the name football manager. so what does this mean? well, football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series, and it has been released earlier than expected. at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year. but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up?\\n\\na game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics. it has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. but that does not do justice to the game really. what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth.\\n\\nyou begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from, for instance england and scotland. that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues, but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south. of course you might be looking for european glory, or to get hold of abramovich's millions, in which case you can take control at chelsea, or even barcelona, real madrid, ac milan ... the list goes on a very long way. once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. sometimes it is promotion, or a place in europe, sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. it might even be a case of champions or else. obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose, so choose wisely. then it is time to look at your squad, work out your tactics, seeing how much cash, if any, you have got to splash, having a look at the transfer market, sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. then bring on the matches, which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2d view. with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface, not much else seems to have changed.\\n\\nhowever, there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games, which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. the match engine is also much improved, and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.\\n\\nwith a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area. and a sport like football, which is so high profile and unpredictable itself, can never be modelled quite to everybody's satisfaction. but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only, and do not affect gameplay. and if there are problems further down the line, sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. in all there are many more tweaks and improvements. if you were a fan of the previous cm games, then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it. if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership, spurs into europe, or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree, fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made. just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas.\\n\\nfootball manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac\\n\",\n",

       " \"no half measures with half-life 2\\n\\ncould half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype? after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.\\n\\nfortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.\\n\\nyou are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.\\n\\nwhereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.\\n\\nconsidering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components, this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.\\n\\nvirtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms, hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii, it's all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.\\n\\nthe game does have a couple of problems. firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.\\n\\na lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.\\n\\nhalf-life 2 is out now for the pc\\n\",\n",

       " 'file-swappers ready new network\\n\\nlegal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.\\n\\none site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are \"quality copies\".\\n\\nin late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called \"trackers\" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to.\\n\\nnow the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek\\'s involvement with exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis.\\n\\nusers of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream.\\n\\ndr johan pouwelse, a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. \"exeem cannot prevent pollution,\" he said. \"the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,\" he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. \"the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that\\'s full of crap like kazaa,\" he said. \"there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,\" he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. \"it\\'s hard to compete with free,\" he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.\\n',\n",

       " 'freeze on anti-spam campaign\\n\\na campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.\\n\\nearlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words \"stay tuned\". no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.\\n\\nlycos europe\\'s \"make love not spam\" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their pc was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial.\\n\\nmonitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.\\n\\nthe downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, \"stay tuned\". the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. \"attacking a spammer\\'s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,\" said graham cluley, senior technology consultant for sophos. \"not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\"\\n',\n",
