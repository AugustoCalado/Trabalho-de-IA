OF THE PSBR IN 1986 87 IS CHIEFLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMARKABLE BUOYANCY OF NON OIL TAX REVENUES IN GENERAL AND THE CORPORATION TAX PAID BY AN INCREASINGLY PROFITABLE BUSINESS SECTOR IN PARTICULAR ON OIL PRICES LAWSON SAID HE WAS STICKING TO HIS EARLIER ASSUMPTION THAT NORTH SEA CRUDE PRICES WILL AVERAGE 15 DLRS PER BARREL IN CALENDAR 1987 HE SAID IT IS CLEAR THAT THE INCREASED FLOW OF NON OIL TAX

BOOK ON CORPORATION TAX HE SAID THE RATE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED AT 35 PCT IN 1987 88 BUT COMPANIES' CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE CHARGED AT THE APPROPRIATE CORPORATION TAX RATE HE SAID THAT UNDER THE NEW

PERIOD ON WHICH THE TAX IS DUE I ALSO PROPOSE TO LEGISLATE NOW TO PAVE THE WAY FOR A NEW METHOD OF COLLECTING CORPORATION TAX TO BE KNOWN AS PAY AND FILE THIS WOULD BE PART OF A WIDER PROGRAMME OF STREAMLINING TAX COLLECTION AND WOULD NOT COME INTO FORCE UNTIL THE EARLY 1990S LAWSON SAID HE PLANNED TWO RELIEFS ON PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX PRT AS FROM TODAY COMPANIES MAY ELECT TO HAVE UP TO 10 PCT
