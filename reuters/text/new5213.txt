IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE SUGAR OUTPUT BEET PRODUCERS HAVE THREATENED TO EFFECTIVELY DUMP NEARLY ONE MLN TONNES OF WHITE SUGAR INTO EC INTERVENTION STOCKS AS THEY FEEL EXPORT SUBSIDIES HAVE BEEN TOO LOW TO COMPENSATE FOR THE GAP BETWEEN HIGH EC INTERNAL AND LOW WORLD MARKET PRICES HOWEVER WITH THE EC BUDGET STRETCHED TO BREAKING POINT THIS COULD GIVE TREASURY MINISTERS EXTRA RESOLVE IN RESISTING
